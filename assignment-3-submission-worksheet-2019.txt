PART 5: WOW US (GRAD STUDENTS ONLY)
Explain why we should be "wowed" by your assignment. Include any relevant HTML and CSS line numbers for us to examine.

Recreating an embedded Tweet was a wow-factor challenge. I found that Twitter does not supply any markup, but they do offer style guides (), which is why I believe my deconstructed/reconstructed Tweet is wow-worthy. The use of the Tweet as an info-pane is also an intentional choice on the index.html page. With this site, I want to challenge the core concept of a Tweet. Is it an official statement? Can it be trusted? What is the source? By using a Twitter card as a container, I ask the viewer about their notion social media and digital consumption. See index.html lines 30-59 and style.css lines 33-60.

The Twitter cards also act as flex boxes for the content within so that the text behaves the same across all Tweets.
