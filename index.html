          <p>If we could hear ourselves interact online, would we change how we Tweet and comment?</p>
          
          If the phone and computer are an extension of our bodies, then social media is the extension, or perhaps plummet, of our minds. Ideas we write and share are very different from ideas we speak and hear.
          
          Most of us hate the sound of our own voice. I think the same think would happen to our consumption habits if we heard it out loud. 
        
          <p>But perhaps not. What if you had an assistant to read, out loud, the media you consume? Would it change how you feel? Behind every comment, headline, or article is a voice - a person.</p>
          
          <p>I believe it speech can pivot how our brains have been programmed to live online. We are visual. We are perfectionists. We are self conscious, judgmental, and quick to react.</p> 
          
          <p>Rather than *look* inward, I propose we listen in, to ourselves and others. Topics, hashtags, people, issues, celebrations, wins, jokes, memes, and each other. "On the Internet, no one knows you are a dog," has a new riff - "On the Internet, no one knows you are a human."</p>
          
          <p>Beyond social re-programming, I suggest a voice agent for Twitter to assist in how we consume our Twitter feeds, or other media.</p> 
          
          <p>Imagine you are a new Twitter user. You've heard of it and understand how it works, but you have never signed up. You are suddenly confronted by the choice of "who do I follow?" "What's worth reading?" "What is trending?" "Who on here is real?"</p>
